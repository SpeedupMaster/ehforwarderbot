# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and specs for this repo live as Markdown files in `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The spec is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/spec.md`
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom under a `## Comments` heading

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`, creating the directory if needed.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the referenced Markdown file. The user will normally provide its path or issue number.

## Wayfinding operations

- Map: `.scratch/<effort>/map.md`
- Child ticket: `.scratch/<effort>/issues/NN-<slug>.md`
- Claim: set `Status: claimed` and save
- Resolve: append the answer under `## Answer`, set `Status: resolved`, then update the map's Decisions-so-far
